      <h3 class="subtitle">Welcome to the Discworld</h3>
      <p>The Discworld is a fantasy world, a flat disc balanced on the backs of four elephants on a tortoise, the Great
        A&#x27;Tuin who swims through space. Filled with outrageous settings, fantastic creatures, and colorful
        characters, the Disc is teeming with adventure, intrigue, and impossible physics.</p>


      <p>Consisting of 41 novels, seven interconnected branches, and seven short stories, the Discworld series is
        nothing short of an epic&#8212;but accessible&#8212;feat of storytelling. Comic fantasy at its best, the novels
        frequently parody or take inspiration from other works of fantasy, mythology, and fairy tales, using them as the
        basis for satirization of current political, social, and scientific issues.</p>

      <p>As it is described in the novel The Last Continent: “The Discworld&#8212;world and mirror of worlds.” The books
        are deeply funny while also asking us to question our assumptions about our own world and introducing us to characters with real dreams and stakes.</p>

      <p>Discworld novels have also won awards such as the Prometheus Award and the Carnegie Medal. In the BBC's Big Read, four Discworld novels were in the top 100, and a total of fourteen in the top 200. More than 80 million Discworld books have been sold in 37 languages.</p>

      <h3 class="subtitle">Sir Terry Pratchett</h3>
      <p>Known affectionately as Sir Pterry to his fans, Sir Terry Pratchett was the master storyteller who created the Discworld. Always wearing his signature black hat, Sir Pratchett created the Discworld initially as a way to poke fun at what he saw as substandard fantasy fiction of the 1980s with the 1983 publication of <span class="italic">The Color of Magic</span>, but the series quickly became much more complex than that.</p>

      <p>Sir Pratchett was a fiercely curious person who loved to learn and write about all aspects of the human condition. He also was invested in social justice, equity, and change, using his writing as a way to advocate for deeply important issues and philosophies. His daughter Rhianna Pratchett wrote, “My father used his anger about inequality, classism, xenophobia and bigotry to help power the moral core of his work.”

      <p>Sir Pratchett unfortunately was diagnosed with Alzeheimers in 2007 and passed away in 2015 at age 66.</p>

    <h3 class="subtitle">The Vimes Boots Index</h3>

    <p>In 2022, UK anti-poverty advocate <a
        href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/26/terry-pratchett-jack-monroe-vimes-boots-poverty-index">Jack Monroe created a price index</a> to track the “insidiously creeping prices” of basic food products. She named it “The Vimes Boots Index” after the beloved character of Sir Samuel Vimes, the commander of the Anhk-Morpork City Watch who often observes social inequality. In the novel Men at Arms, he presents his famous “boots” theory of inequity:</p>

    <blockquote>“The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less money. Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of okay for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles. But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that&#x27;d still be keeping his feet dry in ten years&#x27; time, while a poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.”</blockquote>

    <p>The Pratchett estate gave its blessing to this use of the name, tweeting the Discworld quote, “Sometimes it&#x27;s better to light a flamethrower than curse the darkness” in response.</p>

      <h3 class="subtitle">Books and Series</h3>
      <p>As mentioned, the Discworld series is composed of 41 novels and seven short stories. There are seven interconnected series and seven“branches” of the Discworld, often written in different genres:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Unseen University: featuring the cowardly wizard Rincewind and his colleagues at the Unseen University. Generally a satire of D&D and &#x27;80s fantasy, this series is also full of magic and reluctant adventure.
        </li>
        <li>The Witches: featuring a trio of witches including head witch Granny Weatherwax and the rural kingdom of Lancre. Generally a literary satire of Shakespeare and fairy tales, the Witches brancch is a strong feminist retelling of witches and their relationship to social structure.</li>
        <li>Death: one of the most well-known figures in the Discworld, Death&#8212;the literal personification&#8212;is fascinated with human affairs and often accidentally gets involved. These books often deal with cosmic fantasy, horror, and mythology</li>
        <li>The City Watch: featuring the city watch of Ankh-Morpork, the greatest city of the Disc. This series mixes noir with police procedural with fantasy, asking important questions like “can you charge someone for committing a crime by dragon?,” and focusing on beloved characters.</li>
        <li>Moist Von Lipwig: these books follow the adventures of Moist Von Lipwig, a con man forced in government service in Ankh-Morpork. This trilogy deals with fantasy infrastructure, like what it would be like to run a magical post office</li>
        <li>Tiffany Aching: this YA series features Tiffany Aching, a young girl learning to be a witch and having magical adventures.</li>
        <li>Other Discworld cultures: these books are collected together as a series of one-shots, usually concerning new settings or technologies of the Discworld.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>While so many novels and branches can be intimidating for newcomers, the series is designed to be entered at any point. In fact, many fans have their own recommendations as to which branches and novels to start with. The vast diversity of the Discworld means that there is something for everyone!</p>
